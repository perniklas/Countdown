# Countdown
This is a simple countdown application intended for learning Firebase and making it easier for me to track upcoming events in a less... archaic visualization.

Web SPA hosted in Firebase. Firestore is used as database, but most connections are made through Functions for improved security for both access and written data. Email-based user authentication, but no requirements set for emails.
